                Hi! Welcome to Techy with Torion blog. I plan on spreading knowledge on all things tech that I am familiar with. That consist of Programming, video games, and even robots.
                Look forward to me posting something on the channel at least once a week. I plan on also starting a youtube channel as well to go hand in hand with the blog page.

            <p>
                My love for electronics first started with this little computer I had as a kid that taught me how to spell different words in the form of a game.
                Soon after, I received a nintendo and I fell in love with Super Mario. After various consoles later, I've found myself in love with video games so much that I wanted to create my own.
                I'm currently a software engineer working as a Ruby developer. I'm familiar with various technologies in the field and I plan on going into detail on various
                topics that I'm versed in. I love problem solving and troubleshooting. I enjoy playing Call Of Duty online with friends and playing Madden. Super Smash Bros Ultimate has to be my favorite
                fighting game at the moment. I'm excited to get started here as we go on our journey of learning together

                Hi my techy's and techettes. I hope your day has been well and that you're ready to start learning how to code with me.
                We will be coding in python. First, you'll have to make sure that you have python installed locally on your machine. You
                can find how to do that <a href="https://www.python.org">here</a>. After you're finished there, be sure that you have it
                locally on your machine. A great way to check if you have it is to open a terminal window and type "python3" and press enter.
